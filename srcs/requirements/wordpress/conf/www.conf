; The number of child processes to be created when pm is set to 'static' and the

; This value sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be
; served. Equivalent to the ApacheMaxClients directive with mpm_prefork.
; Equivalent to the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment variable in the original PHP
; CGI. The below defaults are based on a server without much resources. Don't
; forget to tweak pm.* to fit your needs.

; Clear environment in FPM (Fast Process Manager) workers
; Prevents arbitrary environment variables from reaching FPM worker processes
; by clearing the environment in workers before env vars specified in this

; Setting to "no" will make all environment variables available to PHP code
; via getenv(), $_ENV and $_SERVER.
